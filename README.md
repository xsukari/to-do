# Heavily WIP

Which means, the code will still very likely heavily change when you are reading this. Therefore, don't get too worried about leftover debugging code, code for manual testing, and so on... yet :)

## Preview

## Limitations
- This project uses pnpm. You need to have it set up already.

- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Google Fonts.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies with "pnpm install".
2. Run the development server with "pnpm dev".
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
